# 1. Record architecture decisions

**Date:** 2026-01-24

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

Decisions documented here can be superseded by newer ADRs using `adr new -s <number> "Title"` to create a superseding record that links back to the original.
